# Assignment - 1: Understanding Decorators in Python

# Integer Sum Calculator
This script calculates the sum of a list of integers using two different approaches: timed calculation and cached calculation. It utilizes decorators to add additional functionality to the integers_Sum function.

# Prerequisites
Python 3

# Installation
Clone the repository or download the script file.
Ensure that you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download Python from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
pip install frozendict

# Usage
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script file is located.
3. Run the script using the following command:
python Data_Engineer_Assignment_1.py
4. The script will output the sum of the provided integers twice: once with timing information and once with caching. The time taken to run each calculation will be displayed.
5. You can modify the integers list in the script to calculate the sum of different sets of integers.

# Examples
Example usage:
$ python Data_Engineer_Assignment_1.py

Time taken to run timed_sum_integers: 0.0 seconds
